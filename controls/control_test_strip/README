IMU + Magnetometer testing code
_______________________________
This is a stripped down version of the complete testing code for the IMU/Magnetometer.
This only integrates position data in the x-direction, and completely ignores the rate gyro.
Hopefully this should reduce the amount of computational overhead required to read from the device.
If we decide to use the other axis accelerometers or rate gyro, the original code is still in the controls branch in github.

// Use
- Upon upload, the Arduino should initialize the Adafruit board and begin printing data to the console
- Depending on how the variable "mode" is set, it will either be printing x position data or magnetometer data
  - mode=0 for IMU, mode=1 for magnetometer
  - The format of IMU data is [position]
  - The format of Magnetometer data is [x,y,z]
- This is for use with the testing format described in the testing document (please see doc for detailed explanation)

// TODO
- Add testing for IMU value resets
- Actually test it

// 2/6
- Testing procedure based on datasheet, not requirements
- Update IMU test to output acceleration (no specs on position)
- Update magnetometer test to output raw values (non-normalized vector)
